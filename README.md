### Amtek,.s.r.o (2020 - 2022)

During my contract at <a href="https://www.amtek.cz/"> AMTEk, s.r.o.</a>, the main task of my position was designing of security fences from aluminum profiles. Each fence layout is based on the customer's specifications and it is fitted with reinforcements, doors or active-electronic devices (sensors, electronic locks, cameras, security lights, etc.) as needed. Thanks to the variability of the MayCad profile system it is possible to quickly and cheaply create machine frames and thus replace the need for the production of specific parts and welding these parts into larger asemblies.

This network is designated for small lowpower devices, like a sensors and trivial actuators. The introduced version is just concept. Although that algorithm is full-operational, provided security level is not suitable for real-life application.)
