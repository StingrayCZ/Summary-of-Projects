## Information and Communications Technology section
Where I would like to introduce my bachelor thehsis. My first larger programming project. This project is **still uncomplided but active** and will be **finished to end of August 2020**.

The main task of my thesis (see  <a href="https://github.com/StingrayCZ/Summary-of-Projects/blob/master/Folder/Thesis%20(under%20construction).pdf"> here</a>) is proposal the security of communication in the IoT wireless network. This network is designated for small lowpower devices, like a sensors and trivial actuators. The introduced version is just concept. Although that is full-operational, but provided security level is not suitable real-life use.
